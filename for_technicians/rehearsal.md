# Before they arrive
You should be there ~20mins before them, to be able to set up
everything professionally and to avoid hurry-induced errors, fix random issues, etc.


## At the main console
Consult with the worship leader on which instruments will be used,
and who will be at which microphone.

### Set up the SPL meter
 * Turn it on
 * Put it to it's place

### Load vocalists

 * **Mute** and pull to 0 all channels that will not be used.

For each vocal channel that will be used:

 * Select a vocal channel
 * Press **VIEW** on the EQUALIZER
 * Press the **UTILITY** button next to the screen
 * With the (frist) scope knob, select the RECALL SCOPE

* Press **confirm**

### Other things
 * Mute  the pulpit microphone, to avoid feedbacking


## At the stage
* Reset the stage (see [resetting](resetting.md))
* Set up stage to be usable by the musicians
     * Set up correct mic hights
     * Move away obstacles
     * Fold back unused microphones
     * Check stands
    * Check monitor alignments

# After they arrive
 * Be nice, connect with them personally.
 * Help them with what ever they ask.
 * **Align the microphones**
   * Very important!
   * Align height and direction, so that the microphone is in line with the mouth, and points towards them.
   * Meanwhile, keep it in a way so that the sound from the monitor would hit the microphone from the back as much as possible.

## Gain staging
 * Go through all channels (vocal/instruments), and set a proper gain.
   * Ask them one-by-one to play from lowest to highest volume.
   * You only care about their highest, but asking from lowest to highest usually helps them in producing more precise levels.
   * When they are at the highest, they should hit **-18db**
   * **Gain should generally be left alone after this point.**
